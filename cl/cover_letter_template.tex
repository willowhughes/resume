Dear Hiring Manager,

% no em dashes. Don't sound robotic. It should be genuine. Im entry level (intern/newgrad) so I don't have much experience to speak for so a cover letter that is short, sweet and genuine is key. Showing genuine enthusiasm or curiousity.

I am writing to apply for the [Position Title] role at \company. I am excited about [1--2 sentences on why this role/company].

[discuss most relevent experience to job desc or company (if nothing is highly relevent, discuss most impressive work). Try to show value and measurable impact but don't exadgerate]. These experiences align well with your needs in [key requirement] and [key requirement].

I'm eager to discuss how I can contribute to \company. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
