Dear Hiring Manager,

Showing genuine enthusiasm or curiousity. I'd like to avoid talking about premera as much as I can even tho its the most important thing on my resume (def include it but not in depth). No need to list off all the details of every project. prioitize relevency and general interest.

I am writing to apply for the [Position Title] role at [company]. I am excited about [1--2 sentences on why this role/company].

[discuss most relevent experience to job desc or company (if nothing is highly relevent, discuss most impressive work). Try to show value and measurable impact but don't exadgerate]. These experiences align well with your needs in [key requirement] and [key requirement].

I'm eager to discuss how I can contribute to [company]. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
